## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project encouraged me to think about the box like i would normally world. It also made me to really realise the power of flexbox and how important is it to build complex project layout.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

Iike i mentioned either, i realised the real power of flexbox with the project. In the more days, i would be focusing more on building layouts with it so i can be perfect at building complex layout with it.
